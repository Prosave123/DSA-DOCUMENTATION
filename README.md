## project topic: E commerce sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project focuses on evaluating the sales performance of an e-commerce platform over the past year. By examining key parameters within the dataset, we aim to derive meaningful insights that support informed decision-making and help craft compelling narratives about our findings.

### Data Source
The main dataset used in this project is "Data Sale.csv," which is an open-source file. It is freely available for download from platforms like Kaggle, FRED, or other public data repositories.

### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel Used for data cleaning [Download here ](https://www.Microsoft.com)
   - for data collection
   - for data cleaning
      1. Data manipulation
      2. Data munching
- SQL Server ( Utilized for querying and data analysis)  
- Power BI (Used for building interactive reports ) 
- Microsoft PowerPoint (Used for presenting project findings)

 ### Data cleaning and Preparation
During the initial phase of data preparation, the following steps are carried out:  
1. Loading and inspecting the dataset  
2. Identifying and addressing missing values  
3. Cleaning and formatting the data for analysis  

### Exploratory Data Analysis  
EDA involved examining the dataset to answer key questions such as:  
- What is the overall sales trend?  
- Which products are the top sellers?  
- Which products recorded peak sales?

### Data Analysis  
This section includes basic code snippets, SQL queries, or DAX expressions used during the analysis process.
